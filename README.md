The scratch module is provided to act as a space to add temporary
classes while experimenting without forcing you to create your own
module. Not classes should ever be committed as part of the scratch
module.

It also provides a good module to write classes in that are used for
demonstrating bugs in IMP as developers can easily drop the test
classes into their own copy of scratch.
